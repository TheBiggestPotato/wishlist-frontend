# WishLst
This project was made under the guidance of a few Softbinator developers in order to learn and understand React.

The aplication was designed to store and manage interactive wishlists with different items, users and user groups. Unfortunately the application is not yet compleated, with some features yet to be implemented, such as sending notifications or buying items from someone's list.

All in all, as my first React project and experience, I can say that it was challenging, but also very fun. It gave me a good example on how real projects are coded and conducted.

## Installation 

After pulling the repo locally, an `npm install` command should be used in the project directory.
.then(`npm start`)

### Usage

In order to use the application's features, you need to register and further on login.

Afterwards, you will be redirected to the home page. 

Inside the app the user will be able to create wishlist, items and groups. As you will see, those can also be deleted.

A profile page is available to the user, with details that can be changed if needed.

The user has the option to view other users' wishlists, but unfortunatelly not interact with them by buying items.
